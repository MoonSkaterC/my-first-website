 <h2><u>About me</u></h2>
 <p>My name is Chris, I've been stopping and starting to code, but I really want to get into it and start a weekend side-hustle, or even a career from this.
 I currently work in Logistics, and I think brushing up on my coding skills can help with my day-to-day work by creating different ways of making the job efficient.</p>
